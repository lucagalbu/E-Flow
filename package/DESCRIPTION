Title: A filtering for FlowCytometric bacterial data
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Luca", "Galbusera", email = "luca.galbusera@unibas.ch", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: It preprocesses the data from FlowCytometric measurements. For
    every file outputted from a FCM device, it filters out non viable cells by
    discarding cells which are outlier in the scattering plot and it extracts the
    mean and variance of the remaining population through a log-normal fit mixed
    with a uniform distribution. It finally removes the autofluorescence and the
    shot noise introduced by the measuring device.
